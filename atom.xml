    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re back in Buenos Aires after a nice couple of days in laid-back Uruguay (pics will follow once I get this gallery plugin working, grr..).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://ken-b.github.io/images/BA_weather_20131216.PNG"> Back in the huge city where people drive crazy but are oh so friendly and, boy, is it hot! Last night we went for drinks and dinner with a nice Czech couple Jana and Petr. We got some car and travel tips and in return bought the dessert (Taratella) for Ana&rsquo;s birthday :P</p>

<p>We were expecting Andi, our German seller, to arrive today but he had to have his light fixed and is hopefully coming tomorrow. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Also called the Argentinian importer of Art and Lutherie guitars on which shops sell them, only to found out that due to Government import restrictions, they are nowhere to be found. Indeed, the guitar shops here have a lousy selection. I&rsquo;ll just have to wait to buy a little guitar until Chili.</p>

<p>PS: Ana still hasn&rsquo;t written anything yet on the blog, but promised to do so promptly :)</p>

<p>However, this makes the perfect excuse to start testing this Blog&rsquo;s mapping feature. If all goes well, you should see below the location of the beach we were on. Fingers crossed!</p>

<p>PS: check out some older post below, I will retroactively start putting some stories of last week (yeah, it&rsquo;s cheating a bit, I know :P)</p>

<h1>Setup Blogging with <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a></h1>

<h3>Install Ruby</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29">Ruby</a> needs to be installed, but only the package manager <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">gem</a> is used later. On Mac this is usual already installed (type <code>ruby --version</code> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console">terminal</a> to check).</p>

<p>I followed instructions from <a href="http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2011/09/01/runningjekyllwindows.html">this blog</a>, although this guy now has all-in-one portable installation file for windows <a href="http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2013/07/20/buildportablejekyll.html">now</a>, but bandwith is precious in these areas :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Download RubyInstaller 1.93 (not 2.0) from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads</a></li>
<li>on the same page, download the corresponding DevKit</li>
<li>install RubyInstaller to a directory without spaces, eg. <code>C:\Coding\Ruby</code></li>
<li>run DevKit, meaning unwrap to a directory without spaces, eg. <code>C:\Coding\RubyDevKit</code></li>
<li>run start > programs > Ruby 193 > &ldquo;Start command prompt with ruby&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>cd C:\Coding\RubyDevKit</code></li>
<li><code>ruby dk.rb init</code></li>
<li><code>ruby dk.rb install</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Install Git</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a> was already installed, otherwise download and install from <a href="http://git-scm.com/.">http://git-scm.com/.</a></p>

<h3>Get Octopress from Git source</h3>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is an open-source framework around the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generate (also used by github Pages).</p>

<p>Right-click in folder where you want your blog site subfolder (<code>D:\Copy\Travel\Blog</code>) and select <code>Git Bash here</code> (otherwise start>programs>Git>&ldquo;Git bash&rdquo; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_%28command%29"><code>CD</code></a> to directory):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git ken-b.github.io</code></li>
<li><code>cd ken-b.github.io</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Install the ruby dependencies</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>gem install bundler</code></li>
<li><code>bundle install</code></li>
</ul>


<h1>First Time usage</h1>

<ul>
<li>create on <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a> a new repository called <code>ken-b.github.io</code></li>
<li><p>open and update the _config.yml file in <code>D:\Copy\Travel\Blog\octopress</code>, it&rsquo;s self-explanatory.</p></li>
<li><p>install the default theme (still in the <code>D:\Copy\Travel\Blog\octopress</code> folder)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake install</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>setup github (only if newly created and thus empty repository)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake setup_github_pages</code> and enter <code>git@github.com:ken-b/ken-b.github.io.git</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For site generation and deployment run</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake generate</code></li>
<li><code>rake deploy</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Commit source for blog:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git add .</code></li>
<li><code>git commit -m 'first setup'</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin source</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>edit 13/12/2013:</strong> I just saw that octopress handles this quite cleverly. Because GitHub does not allow jekyll plugins, octopress generates the site. The site itself is pushed under the master branch and used for the webpage, while the octopress code is under the source branch. Neat.</p>

<h1>Ongoing usage</h1>

<h3>Start a new blog post</h3>

<p>In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console">command window</a> in the octopress folder</p>

<pre><code>rake new_post["Title of the new post"]
</code></pre>

<p>will create a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> file named <code>YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-new-post.markdown</code> in the <code>\octopress\source\_posts\</code> subfolder. Then edit this file with notepad, sublime or&mdash;as I do&mdash;the free <a href="http://markdownpad.com">MarkdownPad 2</a>.</p>

<p>When done, to preview run</p>

<pre><code>rake preview 
</code></pre>

<p>and check the preview on <a href="http://localhost:4000/.">http://localhost:4000/.</a></p>

<h3>Editing posts</h3>

<p>Markdown is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040402182332/http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">very easy to write and remember</a>, it&rsquo;s like writing in notepad but then <a href="http://trevor-hopkins.com/fiction/miracle2.jpg">some magic happens</a> and&mdash;voil√†&mdash;out comes a formatted site.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/">plugin for adding images</a> using</p>

<pre><code>{% img [class names] /path/to/image [width] [height] [title text [alt text]] %}
</code></pre>

<p>and a <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/video-tag/">plugin for video&rsquo;s</a> using</p>

<pre><code>{% video url/to/video [width height] [url/to/poster] %}
</code></pre>

<h3>Deploying</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re happy with the preview result, run</p>

<pre><code>rake gen_deploy
</code></pre>

<h3>Mapping</h3>

<p>I used the forekd <a href="http://matthewowen.github.com/jekyll-mapping/">jekyll-mapping</a> from <a href="https://github.com/throughnothing/jekyll-mapping">throughnothing</a>. I added an <code>if context['page']['mapping']['show']</code> statement in the ruby script (my first ruby coding ever!) to have the map only show when an extra subkey <code>show</code> is defined for the <code>mapping</code> key in YML of the post.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If it does not seem to update, try <code>jekyll serve --trace</code>, which has more debugging output (I found out after misusing the image tag and not seeing the site update).</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t use tabs in the YML header of your posts, only spaces to indent (that&rsquo;s about 1h of my life I won&rsquo;t get back :\ )</p>

<p>I tried fancyimage_tab.rb jekyll plugin, the old gallery_tab plugin, img_popup and some custom mix of the latter, none of which got working nicely. Finally I followed a German <a href="http://uli-heller.github.io/blog/2013/08/04/gallery/">blog</a> and all went smoothly. They are efficient, ze germanz.</p>

<h1>TODO</h1>

<ul>
<li>Adapt the rather boring default theme</li>
<li>Find out what the possibilities are for class name with image plugin. So far I&rsquo;ve seen <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>left half</code>. Hopefully there&rsquo;s a plugin for a picture album, don&rsquo;t want to use facebook for this (because not everyone&rsquo;s on it).</li>
<li>Get the render_index_map working from jekyll-mapping. So far I&rsquo;ve used the fork of <code>throughnothing</code>, but this does not include the full index map.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2013-12-05T23:45:09-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ken-b.github.io/blog/2013/12/05/its-a-small-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some experiences we had in Buenos Aires really convinced me again that it really (really!) is a small world. Besides the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">interesting mathematical properties</a>, a small world always takes you by surprise and gets a smile on your face just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Here our three examples in a single week!</p>

<ul>
<li>Before leaving for the trip, I went on a long-overdue weekend trip to Madrid to meet my friends from BEST there. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the least of the small-world experience, but it turned out they were also heading for Argentina and right during our stay there! We met up for dinner and later again for coffee in Buenos Aires, just to show that distances only exist in our head. (picture below :)</li>
<li>For the third car we were about to buy (the first one didn&rsquo;t go through because of some differences, the second one was sold while we were on the plane :/ ) we had a good contact with a Tsjech couple on their way to Buenos Aires. However, on a camping a few days before they sold it to some German couple :( Anyway, guess who turned up in our AirBnB to stay in the second room a few days later. Yup, the same Tsjech couple, who actually parked the van in front as they were doing the paperwork a few days later. In a 14 million souls big city, that makes a small world and some irony too.</li>
<li>And for the best one: While ordering lunch in a small bar in San Telmo, numblessly watching football on TV, a girl walked by and I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from yelling: &ldquo;Lisa!&rdquo;. She was a girl who spent a year or so in my class in high school. Appartently she was spending some months in Argentina and we talked for like 2 minutes (which is more than we did in the whole of high school ;). She was more surprised that I recognized her than that she walked into the same little bar at the other side of the globe where I was waiting for my crappy hamburger. Interesting&hellip;</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://ken-b.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/buenos-aires-impressions/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-04T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://ken-b.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/buenos-aires-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Allright, and now for them stories :)</p>

<p>I tried to have Ana write a bit here, but this post just shows my power of conviction.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just start myself then :) First impressions, in no perticular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>After having lived  in Madrid, Hong Kong, New York (and Antwerp!), Buenos Aires feels like the biggest city I&rsquo;ve ever been too. It&rsquo;s really HUGE. You think you can walk just a few blocks to something that looks just close on the map, and it takes you more than 30minutes.</li>
<li>People are super friendly here. Really, it&rsquo;s much faster and agreeable to ask directions or information than looking it up. Just stand for 5 seconds looking confused (and looking like tourists, which we do :) and someone will come up to you asking if they can help. Nice friendly people.</li>
<li>Supermarkets here are weird. We went the first night to a big carrefour (like the hypermarkets in Belgium) and yes, it&rsquo;s big, but they&rsquo;re just stacking shelves with the same basic products. They have less of a selection than in our little proxy Delhaize from Antwerp (definitely less vegetables). And the queue ran for the whole length of the thing and around the corner. Never did I have to wait that long (more than half an hour) to pay. Not that is was a busy evening or anything. Nope, they had like 12 cash registers open, but oh my god do they work slow!</li>
<li>In a closed (non-convertible) money system, you&rsquo;ve got to improvise. We took some dollars in the country and exchanged them in various places: with our AirBnB landlord (worst rate), in an antique shop (good rate) and a few times in avenida Florida, a shopping street half of the people standing around are mumbling &ldquo;cambio&rdquo; when you pass (variable rates). I guess it makes it more fun than using a credit card :P</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s all happening at the zoo (but more on that in a separate post, I hope).</li>
<li>They like their meat! Yes, I got a plate so full of meat (and only meat, of course) that even I couldn&rsquo;t eat. And it&rsquo;s all yummy.</li>
<li>Here a window cleaner <em>really</em> is a dangerous profession.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="bottom" src="http://ken-b.github.io/images/DSC00150.JPG"></p>

<p>I guess by now you&rsquo;re figuring out that I am backdating some of this stuff. We&rsquo;re currently in Uruguay (13th), but as a sort of logbook for later I&rsquo;ll be cheating with the dates. Consufing, right?</p>
