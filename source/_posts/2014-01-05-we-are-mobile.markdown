Checkit, our own [big-ass car](http://xkcd.com/37/) that will hopefully take us all around South America. It easily has the biggest engine I've ever driven, and the car converts -- through some ingenious Tetris moves -- the back part to a full double bed. Nice.

So far I have replaced the stereo system and bought a few little improvements, but I'd say it seems in fine and complete condition to take us [all the way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDw-zFFhFgc).
