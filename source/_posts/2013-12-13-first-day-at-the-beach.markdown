After 10 days of travelling, we spent our first hours at the beach this afternoon. And a nice one it was. So nice we forgot to take pictures :)

However, this makes the perfect excuse to start testing this Blog's mapping feature. If all goes well, you should see below the location of the beach we were on. Fingers crossed!

{% include jekyll_mapping.html %}
{% render_map %}

PS: check out some older post below, I will retroactively start putting some stories of last week (yeah, it's cheating a bit :P)
