After 10 days of travelling, we spent our first hours at the beach this afternoon. And a nice one it was. So nice we forgot to take pictures :)

However, this makes the perfect excuse to start testing this Blog's mapping feature. If all goes well, you should see below the location of the beach we were on. Fingers crossed!

PS: check out some older post below, I will retroactively start putting some stories of last week (yeah, it's cheating a bit, I know :P)
