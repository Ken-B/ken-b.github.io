Allright, and now for them stories :)

I tried to have Ana write a bit here, but this post just shows my power of conviction.

...

I'll just start myself then :) First impressions, in no perticular order:

* After having lived  in Madrid, Hong Kong, New York (and Antwerp!), Buenos Aires feels like the biggest city I've ever been too. It's really HUGE. You think you can walk just a few blocks to something that looks just close on the map, and it takes you more than 30minutes.
* People are super friendly here. Really, it's much faster and agreeable to ask directions or information than looking it up. Just stand for 5 seconds looking confused (and looking like tourists, which we do :) and someone will come up to you asking if they can help. Nice friendly people.
* Supermarkets here are weird. We went the first night to a big carrefour (like the hypermarkets in Belgium) and yes, it's big, but they're just stacking shelves with the same basic products. They have less of a selection than in our little proxy Delhaize from Antwerp (definitely less vegetables). And the queue ran for the whole length of the thing and around the corner. Never did I have to wait that long (more than half an hour) to pay. Not that is was a busy evening or anything. Nope, they had like 12 cash registers open, but oh my god do they work slow! 
* In a closed (non-convertible) money system, you've got to improvise. We took some dollars in the country and exchanged them in various places: with our AirBnB landlord (worst rate), in an antique shop (good rate) and a few times in avenida Florida, a shopping street half of the people standing around are mumbling "cambio" when you pass (variable rates). I guess it makes it more fun than using a credit card :P
* It's all happening at the zoo (but more on that in a separate post, I hope).
* They like their meat! Yes, I got a plate so full of meat (and only meat, of course) that even I couldn't eat. And it's all yummy.
* Here a window cleaner *really* is a dangerous profession.

I guess by now you're figuring out that I am backdating some of this stuff. We're currently in Uruguay (13th), but as a sort of logbook for later I'll be cheating with the dates. Consufing, right?
