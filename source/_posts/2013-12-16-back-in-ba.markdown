We're back in Buenos Aires after a nice couple of days in laid-back Uruguay (pics will follow once I get this gallery plugin working, grr..).

{% img left /images/BA_weather_20131216.PNG %} Back in the huge city where people drive crazy but are oh so friendly and, boy, is it hot! Last night we went for drinks and dinner with a nice Czech couple Jana and Petr. We got some car and travel tips and in return bought the dessert (Taratella) for Ana's birthday :P

We were expecting Andi, our German seller, to arrive today but he had to have his light fixed and is hopefully coming tomorrow. Fingers crossed. 

Also called the Argentinian importer of Art and Lutherie guitars on which shops sell them, only to found out that due to Government import restrictions, they are nowhere to be found. Indeed, the guitar shops here have a lousy selection. I'll just have to wait to buy a little guitar until Chili.

PS: Ana still hasn't written anything yet on the blog, but promised to do so promptly :)
